# MapApp
Application, which may help delivery companies to plan routes around the World. 
The main focus of this app is to make route planning easier for the delivery, this is why in our app routing can be made by simply providing orders numbers, not just street addresses. Then based on order information or more precisely on shipment and delivery addresses, applicatoin will calculate the best possible route. This route is optimized and addresses visiting order is taken into account, since shipment address should be visited first and only after that delivery.
The application also offer such a great additional settings as avoiding city centers option and taking into account real time traffic situation(Finland only).
The application uses differrent tools and engines for providing that functionality which are the Open route service(routing), Vroom project(optimization) and the Trafi API(traffic situation).
